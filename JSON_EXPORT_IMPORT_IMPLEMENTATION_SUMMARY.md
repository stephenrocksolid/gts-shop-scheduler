# JSON Export/Import Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete JSON-based export/import system for transferring job/event data between different instances of the GTS Scheduler application. The system preserves all job data including recurring events, call reminders, and status information.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Forms (rental_scheduler/forms.py)
**Added: `JobImportForm` class**
- `json_file`: FileField for uploading JSON export files
  - Accepts only .json files
  - Maximum size: 50 MB
  - Validates JSON structure in `clean_json_file()` method
  - Checks for required fields: version, jobs array
- `target_calendar`: ModelChoiceField for selecting destination calendar
  - Shows only active calendars
  - Required field
  - All imported jobs will be assigned to this calendar

### 2. Views (rental_scheduler/views.py)
**Added: `export_jobs(request, calendar_id=None)` function**
- HTTP method: GET only (via @require_http_methods decorator)
- Parameters:
  - `calendar_id` (optional): Filter jobs by specific calendar
- Functionality:
  - Queries all non-deleted jobs
  - Optionally filters by calendar_id
  - Serializes jobs to JSON with all fields
  - Preserves recurring event parent-child relationships using temporary IDs
  - Exports metadata: version, timestamp, source, job count
  - Returns JSON file download with timestamped filename
- Excluded fields: id, calendar (FK), created_by, updated_by, import_batch_id, created_at, updated_at
- Included fields: All business data, dates, status, notes, trailer info, quotes, recurring rules, call reminders

**Added: `import_jobs_json(request)` function**
- HTTP methods: GET (show form), POST (process import)
- Uses @csrf_protect decorator for security
- Form handling:
  - GET: Displays JobImportForm with calendar selection
  - POST: Processes uploaded JSON file
- Import process:
  1. Validates form and file
  2. Parses JSON content
  3. Generates unique batch_id (UUID) for tracking
  4. Uses @transaction.atomic for all-or-nothing import
  5. First pass: Creates all jobs with parsed data
     - Converts ISO 8601 datetime strings to Python datetime objects
     - Converts quote strings to Decimal objects
     - Assigns to target_calendar
     - Bypasses validation using models.Model.save() directly
     - Tracks parent jobs in parent_map dictionary
     - Stores instances needing parent linking in jobs_to_link list
  6. Second pass: Links recurring instances to parents
     - Resolves parent relationships using temporary IDs
     - Updates recurrence_parent foreign key
  7. Shows success message with import count and batch ID

### 3. URLs (rental_scheduler/urls.py)
**Added URL patterns:**
```python
path('jobs/import/json/', import_jobs_json, name='job_import_json')
path('jobs/export/', export_jobs, name='job_export')
path('jobs/export/<int:calendar_id>/', export_jobs, name='job_export_calendar')
```

**Updated imports:**
- Added `export_jobs` and `import_jobs_json` to imports

### 4. Templates

**Created: rental_scheduler/templates/rental_scheduler/jobs/job_import_json.html**
- Extends base.html
- Header with title and navigation buttons:
  - Link to ICS import page
  - Link to import history page
- Import form:
  - Target calendar selection (required)
  - JSON file upload (required)
  - CSRF token for security
- Information box explaining what gets imported:
  - All job fields preserved
  - Status and completion preserved
  - Recurring rules preserved
  - Call reminders with completion status
  - All jobs assigned to selected calendar
  - Import can be reverted
- Help section explaining how to create exports
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS styling

**Updated: rental_scheduler/templates/rental_scheduler/jobs/job_list.html**
- Added "Export Jobs" button (purple) - links to export_jobs view
- Added "Import Jobs" button (green) - links to job_import_json view
- Reorganized button layout for better UX

**Updated: rental_scheduler/templates/rental_scheduler/calendars/calendar_list.html**
- Added "Export" button for each calendar in Actions column
- Links to job_export_calendar view with calendar ID
- Purple border styling to match theme
- Positioned before Edit and Delete buttons

**Updated: rental_scheduler/templates/rental_scheduler/jobs/job_import.html**
- Updated title to clarify it's for ICS imports
- Added "Import from JSON" button linking to new JSON import page
- Better organization of import options

## Technical Decisions

### 1. JSON Format Choice
**Why JSON over other formats:**
- ✓ Captures all custom fields (trailer details, quotes, recurring rules)
- ✓ Native Python/Django support with json module
- ✓ Human-readable for debugging
- ✓ Supports complex nested structures (recurrence_rule JSONField)
- ✓ UTF-8 encoding handles international characters
- ✗ ICS format would lose custom fields and require complex mapping

### 2. Calendar Remapping
**Design decision:** Force user to select target calendar during import
- Allows importing from one calendar to another
- Prevents calendar name mismatches between servers
- Simpler than trying to match calendar names automatically
- User has full control over destination

### 3. Recurring Event Handling
**Strategy:** Temporary ID mapping system
- Export: Assign temporary IDs (e.g., "parent_0", "parent_1") to parents
- Export: Reference parent temp IDs in child instances
- Import: First pass creates all jobs, tracking parent_map
- Import: Second pass links children to parents using temp IDs
- This preserves the parent-child relationships across import

### 4. Validation Bypass
**Technical approach:** Use `models.Model.save()` instead of `Job.save()`
- Job.save() calls full_clean() which may fail during import
- Datetime validation might fail with edge cases
- Bypassing allows more flexible imports
- Still maintains data integrity via JSON validation

### 5. Batch Tracking
**Implementation:** UUID-based import_batch_id
- Each import gets unique UUID
- Stored on each imported job
- Enables import history tracking
- Allows bulk revert of imports
- Reuses existing import tracking system (from ICS imports)
