# Thunderbird Calendar Import - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete calendar import system that allows importing `.ics` (iCalendar) files from Mozilla Thunderbird into the Django GTS Scheduler application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies
- ✅ Added `icalendar==6.1.0` to `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Installed the library successfully

### 2. Form (`rental_scheduler/forms.py`)
- ✅ Created `CalendarImportForm` with:
  - File upload field (`.ics` files only)
  - Calendar selection dropdown (active calendars only)
  - File validation (extension and size limit: 10MB)

### 3. Import View (`rental_scheduler/views.py`)
- ✅ Created `calendar_import` view with full import logic
- ✅ Implemented helper functions:
  - `extract_phone_from_text()` - Extracts phone numbers from event titles using regex
  - `parse_ics_datetime()` - Converts iCalendar dates to timezone-aware Django datetimes
  - `convert_rrule_to_json()` - Converts iCalendar RRULE to JSON format for recurring events

### 4. Field Mapping (As Specified)
```
iCalendar Field          →  Django Job Field
─────────────────────────────────────────────
SUMMARY                  →  business_name (with phone extracted)
SUMMARY (phone part)     →  phone
DESCRIPTION              →  notes
CREATED                  →  date_call_received
DTSTART                  →  start_dt
DTEND                    →  end_dt
VALUE=DATE               →  all_day = True
RRULE                    →  recurrence_rule (JSON)
(all imports)            →  status = 'uncompleted'
```

### 5. Features Implemented

#### Phone Extraction
- Handles multiple formats:
  - `740-501-9004` (standard)
  - `231-6407` (short format)
  - `(330) 265-4243` (with parentheses)
  - `330 265-4243` (with spaces)
  - `7405019004` (no separators)

#### All-Day Event Detection
- Automatically detects all-day events when `VALUE=DATE` is used
- Sets proper time boundaries (00:00 to 23:59:59)
- Sets `all_day` field correctly

#### Recurring Event Support (RRULE)
Converts iCalendar RRULE format to JSON:
- `FREQ=YEARLY` → `{"type": "yearly", "interval": 1}`
- `FREQ=MONTHLY` → `{"type": "monthly", "interval": 1}`
- `FREQ=WEEKLY` → `{"type": "weekly", "interval": 1}`
- `FREQ=DAILY` → `{"type": "daily", "interval": 1}`
- Supports `INTERVAL`, `COUNT`, and `UNTIL` parameters

#### Error Handling
- Validates required fields (start/end dates)
- Skips events with missing critical data
- Logs errors with event UID for debugging
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Tracks import statistics (imported, skipped, errors)

### 6. Template (`rental_scheduler/templates/rental_scheduler/jobs/job_import.html`)
- ✅ Beautiful, modern UI matching project design
- ✅ File upload form with calendar selector
- ✅ Field mapping reference guide
- ✅ Detailed import results display:
  - Success/skipped/error counts
  - Error detail list (up to 20 errors shown)
  - Quick navigation links (Calendar, Job List, Import Another)

### 7. URL Configuration
- ✅ Added route: `/jobs/import/`
- ✅ Named URL: `rental_scheduler:calendar_import`
- ✅ Added "Import Calendar" button to Job List page

### 8. Testing Results
All tests passed successfully! ✅

- The import is transactional - if an event fails, others continue to import
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Supports standard iCalendar format (RFC 5545)

## Success Metrics

✅ **All requirements met:**
- Field mapping as specified ✓
- Calendar selection during import ✓
- Status handling (uncompleted) ✓

## Testing with Your File

The provided file `ServiceCalendarTest(10-20-25).ics` contains:
- Mixed all-day and timed events
- Events with phone numbers in various formats
- Recurring yearly events
- CANCELLED status events (will import as 'uncompleted')
