## Canonical references

- Guide: `docs/features/recurring-events/guide.md`
- API: `docs/features/recurring-events/api.md`

## Invariants to preserve

- A recurring series is modeled as:
  - a **parent job** with `recurrence_rule`
  - **instance jobs** with `recurrence_parent` + `recurrence_original_start`
- “Forever” series are supported via **virtual occurrences** in the calendar feed:
  - `extendedProps.type` includes `virtual_job` / `virtual_call_reminder`
  - UI materializes via `POST /api/recurrence/materialize/`
- Delete scopes for recurring delete use:
  - `this_only`, `this_and_future`, `all`
