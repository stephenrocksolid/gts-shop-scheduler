## Canonical docs

- Start here: `docs/README.md`
- Frontend architecture: `docs/architecture/frontend.md`
- Backend architecture: `docs/architecture/backend.md`
- URL strategy: `docs/reference/urls-and-routing.md`
- Frontend globals/contracts: `docs/reference/frontend-globals.md`

## Rules (keep the repo from drifting)

- If you change a **contract** (URLs, JS globals, event schemas, storage keys), update the relevant doc(s) in the same change.
- Prefer **links to code** over duplicating long code blocks in docs.
- Archive planning docs under `docs/archive/` instead of keeping them in repo root.
