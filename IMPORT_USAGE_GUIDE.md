## Troubleshooting

### "File must have a .ics extension"
- Make sure you selected the iCalendar format when exporting
- Rename the file to end with `.ics` if needed

### "File size must be less than 10MB"
- Your calendar is too large
- Export a smaller date range
- Or split into multiple files

### "Event skipped: missing start or end date"
- Some events in your calendar don't have dates
- These will be skipped automatically
- Check the error details for which events

### Events not appearing correctly
- Check the calendar you selected
- Make sure dates are in the correct timezone
- View job details to see all imported fields

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Export Recent Events**: Export only the date range you need
2. **Check Before Import**: Review your Thunderbird calendar first
3. **Choose Right Calendar**: Select the appropriate target calendar
4. **Start Small**: Try importing a small file first to test
5. **Review After**: Check a few imported jobs to ensure accuracy

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages on the results page
2. Review the import log in the Django admin
3. Verify your `.ics` file is valid (open in a text editor)
4. Make sure all required fields are present in your events

## Advanced: Understanding Phone Extraction

- `740-501-9004` ‚úì
- `231-6407` ‚úì
- `(330) 265-4243` ‚úì
